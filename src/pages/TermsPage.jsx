        <p>
          Welcome to KunTips. These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use
          of the KunTips website and platform (“Service”). By accessing or using
          KunTips, you agree to these Terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          KunTips is a digital tipping platform that allows fans to send
          voluntary monetary tips to online creators. KunTips is a service
          operated by Eternal AS, Norway.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          Because KunTips is a financial tipping service, you must be at least
          18 years old and have the legal capacity to enter into a binding
          agreement. Creators must also be legally able to receive income in
          their jurisdiction.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Nature of Service</h2>
        <p>
          KunTips facilitates voluntary monetary tips from fans to creators.
          Tips are not payments for goods, services, or guaranteed access to
          any content or interaction. KunTips does not host, sell, or provide
          access to creator content of any kind and may not be used as a
          storefront or paywall. Tips are final and non-refundable except where
          required by law or by our payment processor’s policies.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Creator Payouts</h2>
        <p>
          Creators receive a percentage of each tip after KunTips’ platform fee
          and payment processor deductions. The exact percentage varies based on
          creator tier and activity level. KunTips does not guarantee earnings.
          Creators are responsible for declaring and paying applicable taxes and
          complying with local laws.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Prohibited Uses</h2>
        <p>
          You may not use KunTips for any illegal, harmful, misleading, or
          high-risk activities, including activities prohibited under Stripe’s
          Restricted Businesses list. This includes, without limitation:
          activities involving minors; non-consensual material; unlawful or
          regulated content; abusive or fraudulent practices; or any
          age-restricted or adult-oriented services.
          KunTips is a tipping-only platform and may not be used to sell,
          deliver, or provide access to goods, services, or digital content.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Payments & Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          Payments are processed securely by Stripe, our third-party payment
          provider. KunTips does not store or access credit card details. Tips
          are generally non-refundable. Refunds, if issued, follow Stripe’s
          policies and card-network rules.
        </p>

        <p>
          Refunds and bank disputes may result in deductions from creator
          balances to cover Stripe&apos;s non-refundable processing costs and
          dispute fees. KunTips does not charge any platform fee in situations
          where the creator does not earn money.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Service Availability</h2>
        <p>
          We may modify, suspend, or discontinue any part of KunTips at any
          time. We are not liable for interruptions or delays.
        </p>

        <h2>7. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>
          You agree not to interfere with the platform, misuse the tipping
          system, attempt to access unauthorized areas, or harass creators or
          staff.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Please review our Privacy Policy to understand how we handle data.
          KunTips collects minimal personal data and never stores payment card
          information.
        </p>

        <h2>9. Liability</h2>
        <p>
          KunTips and Eternal AS are not responsible for creator behavior,
          misuse of the platform, or payments declined or disputed by banks. To
          the extent permitted by law, our liability is limited to the total
          amount you paid through KunTips in the past 6 months.
        </p>

        <h2>10. Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          We may update these Terms from time to time. Continued use of the
          Service indicates acceptance of updated Terms.
