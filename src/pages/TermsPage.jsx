          using KunTips, you agree to these Terms.
        </p>

        <p>
          KunTips is a digital tipping platform that allows fans to send
          voluntary monetary tips to online creators. KunTips is a service
          operated by Eternal AS, Norway.

        <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>

        </p>

        <h2>2. Nature of Service</h2>
        <p>
          KunTips facilitates voluntary tips from fans to creators. Tips are not
          payments for goods, services, or guaranteed access to content. Tips
          are final and non-refundable except where required by law or by
          CCBill’s policies.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Creator Payouts</h2>
        <p>
          Creators receive a percentage of each tip after KunTips’ platform fee
          and payment processor deductions. The exact percentage varies based on
          creator tier and activity level. KunTips does not guarantee any
          earnings. Creators are responsible for declaring and paying any
          applicable taxes and complying with local laws.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Prohibited Content</h2>
        <p>
          Creators may not use KunTips for content involving minors,
          non-consensual material, illegal activities, copyright infringement,
          fraud, or harmful conduct. Violations may result in suspension or
          permanent removal.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Payments & Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          Payments are processed securely by CCBill, our third-party payment
          processor. KunTips does not store or access credit card details. Tips
          are generally non-refundable. Refunds, if issued, follow CCBill’s
          rules.

          time. We are not liable for interruptions or delays.
        </p>

        <h2>7. User Conduct</h2>
        <p>
          You agree not to interfere with the platform, misuse the tipping
          system, attempt to access unauthorized areas, or harass creators or
          staff.
